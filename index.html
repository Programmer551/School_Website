              ducation is the process of facilitating learning, or the
              acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits.
              Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling,
              discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place
              under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate
              themselves.[1] Education can take place in formal or informal
              settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way
              one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The
              methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.education in zambia

              Many public schools provide a free education through the
              government. Parents may send their own children to a private
              schools, but they must pay for it. In some poorer places, some
              children cannot go to school, because their countries do not make
              education available in their countries, or because their families
              do not have enough money, or because the children have to work for
              money, or because the society have negative prejudice on education
              for girls.The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE,
              became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of
              Ancient Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built
              in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse
              of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.

              Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
              knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
              pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
              imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from
              one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their
              knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through
              imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at
              the time of the Middle Kingdom. Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi
              (right) in the Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in
              1607 Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of
              higher learning in Europe.
